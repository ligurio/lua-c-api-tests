  lua-c-api-tests is an open-source project that provides
  continuous fuzzing for Lua runtimes: PUC Rio Lua and LuaJIT.
  It aims to make these open-source software more secure and
  stable by combining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable,
  distributed execution. As of August 2024, lua-c-api-tests has
  helped identify and fix 5 bugs in PUC Rio Lua and 18 bugs in
  LuaJIT.
